\subsection*{Four generic data science questions}
The questions vary in their difficulty and prediction into the future:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{What} happened?
  \item \textbf{Why} did it happen?
  \item What will happen in the \textbf{future}?
  \item What is the \textbf{best} that can happen?
\end{enumerate}

Important while answering these questions is to keep attention to all three pipeline steps, so not only what analysis we need to perform to answer them, but also how we collect our input (data) and how to deal with our output (result).

\subsection*{Terminology}
Important to see for all of data science: many different names are used to refer to the key disciplines contributing to data science.
\begin{itemize}
  \item This includes statistics, data analytics, data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, process mining, generative AI, etc.
  \item Since frequently the same name is used for different concepts \begin{note}(names describe heavily overlapping areas)\end{note}, they really need to be put in context and interpreted accordingly.
\end{itemize}

The point can be highlighted when looking at scoping machine learning. Here are examples of confusions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sometimes "machine learning" is used as a synonym for "deep neural networks" and sometimes they cover the entire spectrum of learning techniques.
  \item Neural networks can be used as classifiers. But this doesn't imply that numerous classification techniques developed in data mining are part of machine learning in the narrow sense.
\end{itemize}
How confusing specifically the arrangement of terms around machine learning is and how fluent and unclear the actual terms are, is depicted in \ref{fig:1_ml_terminology}.
