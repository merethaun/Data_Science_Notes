\subsection*{Importance of visualization}
We now looked at how we can represent our data in a very machine-friendly represented way. The following subsection shows, why visualization of data has any importance, even though tabular data already captures the features nicely.

It is important as a human to explore your data before applying mathematical operations to see, which techniques make sense to apply to the provided data. \begin{note}As an extreme example, we will take a look at \textbf{Anscombe's quartet} created by Francis Anscombe in 1973. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{assets/visualization_and_extraction/anscombes_quartet.png}
  \caption{Anscombes quartet}
  \label{fig:2_anscombes_quartet}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item You can see the raw data of all four datasets in the table in \ref{fig:2_anscombes_quartet}. Since the format isn't human-friendly to read, you might not see any significant differences in the data.
  \item Now consider applying the evaluation depicted below the data table. As you can see: all of the properties that are evaluated are exactly the same for all datasets.
  \item BUT, if you visualize the datasets, e.g. as simple scatter plots, you see, how drastically they vary. These show the importance of first exploring your data, to then have a better evaluation foundation for the applied techniques.
\end{itemize} 
\end{note}

\begin{note}The next example highlighting the importance of visualization and especially of a \end{note}fitting and well-thought-out visualization\begin{note} is the diagram as shown in \ref{fig:2_napoleon}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{assets/visualization_and_extraction/napolean.png}
  \caption{Multi-feature visualization (Napoleon's army)}
  \label{fig:2_napoleon}
\end{figure}

The chart shows the following aspects, which are quite a lot, while still keeping a good overview:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The number of men in Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign army,
  \item Their movements (direction),
  \item The temperature encountered on the return path,
  \item All given a specific geographic point.
\end{itemize}
\end{note}

\begin{note}The final example highlights the importance of \end{note}visualizing event or process data\begin{note}. In \ref{fig:2_event_data} we see the plot of different given event data input.\end{note} With the visualization, some sort of trend, similarities, certain batching areas, etc. can be directly seen.

\subsection*{Good and poor visualizations}
With statistics and especially visualization, one can really manipulate the view on the provided data, so basically introduces a very strong bias. There's actually a whole book about it, called "How to Lie with Statistics". The following images in \ref{fig:2_manipulate_perception} show some examples.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{assets/visualization_and_extraction/lie/middle.png}
    \subcaption{Choosing the \textbf{middle}}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textcolor{black}{\small Arithmetical average} \textcolor{gray}{\footnotesize  (gets pumped up by rare but high maximum)}
      \item \textcolor{black}{\small Median} \textcolor{gray}{\footnotesize  (standing in middle)}
      \item \textcolor{black}{\small Mode} \textcolor{gray}{\footnotesize  (most frequently occurring)}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{subfigure}\hspace*{0.05\textwidth}
  \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{assets/visualization_and_extraction/lie/scale.png}
    \subcaption{Tampering with \textbf{scales}}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textcolor{black}{\small Easy manipulation of difference perception} 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{subfigure}

  \vspace*{0.5cm}
  \begin{subfigure}{0.7\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{assets/visualization_and_extraction/lie/factor.png}
    \subcaption{Visualizing \textbf{factor} two}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textcolor{black}{\small Adjusting the whole volume according to height makes the difference seem more severe than just taking two instances} 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{subfigure}

\end{figure}

As a good example, one can consider the information visualization book "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" from Edward Rolf Tufte. It encourages the use of \textbf{data-rich illustrations} representing all available data such that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item One can check individual values, while still
  \item Seeing trends and patterns when looking at the whole.
\end{itemize}
